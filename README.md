# Tic-Tac-Toe

A repo for my Tic Tac Toe project. Through this project I learned:

1) How to create and change CSS variables using JavaScript.
2) How to use and work with advanced CSS selectors like :not and :hover.
3) Its a lot easier to assign classes than trying to change the properties of :hover.
4) Using JavaScript to make a webiste more dynamic.

Images used in the making of this project were used from:
